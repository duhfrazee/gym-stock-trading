# Stock Trading Gym
Stock Trading Gym is an OpenAI Gym environment for stock trading with integrations into Alpaca trade api for live and paper trading.

## Basics
For a better understanding of OpenAI Gym, check out the docs: https://github.com/openai/gym

Stock Trading Gym uses OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) aggregate bars as market data and provides unrealized profit/loss as the reward.

Alpaca Stock Trading Gym allows you to use the model trained in the Stock Trading Gym to test against the live market in the form of paper or live trading. You must have an Alpaca Brokerage account (and API keys) to use this environment. Its free so don't let this hold you back. You can find Alpaca's website here: https://alpaca.markets
